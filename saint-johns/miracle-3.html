<h1>The Third Miracle</h1>
<h3>Spring 2019</h3>
<p>Warning: This is a multi-month split up story of multiple stories.</p>

<h4>February 7, 2019</h4>
<p>Wait hold on, didn't another thing happen this day? <a href="miracle-1.html">hmm.......</a></p>
<p>My favorite time of the month has come again. I get to hang with friends and other Saint John's students.<br>
It is a monthly gathering like no other.</p>
<p>Each monthly gathering has its own theme, this time it was relationships.</p>
<p>This triggered some emotion in me, since I have never had a girlfriend.</p>
<p><i>But Ben, didn't <a href="../middleschool/dinnerdance.html">this</a> happen.</i> Shut up.</p>
<p><i>(That was some crazy girl at a middle school dance, doesn't count.)</i></p>
<p>After a talk, I met my first two seniors. There was supposed to be a dance the next day and we talked for like ten minutes.</p>

<h4>March 21, 2019</h4>
<p>Monthly gathering again. (theme: priorities)</p>
<p>I give a talk, from my heart, not written down, about priorities in my life and how they affected me.</p>
<p>I meet more seniors, count goes from 2 to 7.</p>
<p>I was asked to write it down and finish it the next day, which I did. (i may upload a censored version here)</p>

<h4>April 4, 2019</h4>
<p>(theme: you)</p>
<p>They now expect me to do this talk (I didn't commit, like they wouldn't be surpised.)</p>
<p>I ge a nice hug after that one.</p>

<h4>May 2, 2019</h4>
<p>(theme: thanking the seniors)</p>
<p>Didn't give the speech. Gave it to Mr. Paul, he read it, we discussed it after like a week of waiting on May 20.</p>
