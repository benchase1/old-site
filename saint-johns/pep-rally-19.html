<title>Pep Rally 2019 - Ben Chase</title>

<h1>Pep Rally 2019</h1>
<h3>September 20, 2019</h3>

<p>First of all, not as good as <a href="pep-rally-18.html">last year.</a></p>

<p>I had high hopes going into this rally.</p>

<p>It was pretty much the entire school watching the seniors have fun. They did the seating assignment in such a way that the football team got the attention. Not a very good start for this year's sensei.</p>

<p>That was a painful 45 minutes for me. Talking to friends afterwards, we concluded that the rally was actually bad.</p>

<p>I'm not going into any more detail. <i>(If you do know me, shoot me an email, which can be found on the <a href="../contact.html">Contact page</a>.)</i></p>
