<i>Editor&rsquo;s note: This speech is actually transcribed from my YouTube video, &ldquo;P-Cubed: A Saint John&rsquo;s Experience&rdquo;, published on November 26, 2019. The italicized words were said by the audience listening to me.</i></p>

<p><b>Theme:</b> Thanksgiving</p>

<p>I definitely want to say, besides being thankful for my family, in which I am, I am thankful for P-Cubed, just because of how much it has changed my life. Umm, I got Oscar here filming for me, which brings me into my next point.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for those who have supported me over the years, especially with me, let&rsquo;s make a bold statement here, it might be an unpopular opinion, being a P-Cubed leader. I&rsquo;m thankful for Mr. Paul for giving me a chance.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also like to thank you for the support on my, very little people in this room know about my YouTube channel. <i>Plug it, plug it!</i> Uh, subscribe to Ben Chase! The one with the picture of me on there. <i>What&rsquo;s it called? Ben Chase! (Editor&rsquo;s note: This is very loud.) </i></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not subscribed, do it. Ayy! <i>(Editor&rsquo;s note: Somebody did it and held up their phone.)</i> I&rsquo;ve been making videos for nearly six years-<i>shh</i>-I've been making videos for nearly six years now, and my anniversary will be coming up in January.</p>

<p><i>Yessir. How many subscribers?</i> I have 70 subscribers. <i>71, 75, 77! Woohoo! He&rsquo;s now up to 80, 81!</i> Every year, on my anniversary, I put out a video. <i>84! Guys, guys, quiet down for a minute. 88!</i></p>

<p>Alright, so every year on my anniversary, which is January 17th, I put out a video to celebrate one extra year passing, and the announcement I&rsquo;d like to make is that-<i>89</i>-this year, the sixth anniversary, will be called &ldquo;Creator. Leader. Pioneer.&rdquo; <i>(Editor&rsquo;s note: No, this was eventually called &ldquo;Six Years on YouTube&rdquo;. Boring, I know.)</i> and is a reference to how great P-Cubed has been, especially to the development of me, to the development of the channel, and to help me get friends and keep the channel going. Thank you. <i>Yessir!</i></p>
