<h1>"My Life as a P-Cubed Leader"</h1>
<h3>November 12, 2019</h3>

<p>"My Life as a P-Cubed Leader" is an article I wrote for the school's newspaper (do other schools even have these anymore?). It is based on the fact that I am currently in my second year of being a P-Cubed leader.</p>

<p>This was the first article I wrote for the paper. I had heard about the club from my religion teacher this year, who is one of the club moderators. I received great feedback from both students and teachers.</p>

<p>I highly recommend writing for a school newspaper.</p>

<p>The censored document is now available <a href="http://file.benchase.tk/newspaper-111219.html">online</a>.</p>

<p>December 9, 2019 - The article has been published! Nothing was changed at all (not even the next P-Cubed day, December 12 (moved from the 5th)). I got good feedback from my friends. Hopefully I'll write another article in the future, not sure what to do it on though.
This artcle made the front page of the paper. I don't know how that decision was made.</p>
