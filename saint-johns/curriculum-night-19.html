<title>Curriculum Night 2019 - Ben Chase</title>

<h1>Curriculum Night 2019</h1>
<h3>September 19, 2019</h3>

<p>This was my first time helping out at a school event this year. It went well.</p>

<p>The night started for volunteers at 5:00, and lasted until 8:00, but I was only there until 6:15.</p>

<p>I was assigned to directing traffic in the parking lot with one other kid, which was one of the coolest things I've done at Saint John's.
I even got to wave a bus through. Many parents said hi, and a few asked me where they should be going, because they needed to know their son's homeroom.</p>

<p>Once the parking lot was full, I went inside for all of 15 minutes, and got to chat with some parents who were free at that time.
I specifically remember one mom who had no idea where she was going, didn't know the class or the teacher.
Note that the school did hand out copies of their son's schedule, which she forgot to grab.</p>

<p><i>Yikes this one is short. Well it was only one hour in real time.</i></p>
