    <h1>The Second Miracle</h1>
    <h3>March 11, 2019</h3>

    <p>It happened again.</p>
    <p>I got another kid to shadow me at Saint John's.</p>
    <p>But it almost happened earlier......</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Side Story - February 12, 2019</h4>
    <p>It was Friday, February 8, and the Admissions lady walked in to my homeroom.</p>
    <p>The host for Tuesday was absent, and she asked who else had the interests. She said she'd decide betwene me and someone else (who by the way is a teacher's pet)</p>

    <p>I stopped by her office later that day, she told me that I wouldn't be getting this kid, mainly because I had Max the day before.</p>
    <p>She also told me that Max's dad stopped by (who works at the school) and told her that I had done a great job.</p>
    <p>The teacher's pet also didn't get the kid.</p>
    <p><b>End Side Story</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm in homeroom on March 8th.</p>
    <p>She walks in, like she does everyday with a smile on her face, and calls my name. It was 8:i-didnt-look-at-the-clock am and I'm fully awake. I'm aware that I may have a math test (which was moved) and sign the paper.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Once Monday morning comes, I'm ready and I'm there before Amith (the kid's name). I go to homeroom and check in with Tony and tell him "I'm gonna get the...I'm not gonna repeat that line again". That line was "I'm gonna go get the kid" which I said before getting Max.</p>
    <p>I had Amith for the entire day this time around, since I had no tests.</p>

    <p><b>English - 1st Period</b></p>
    <p>Okay, in English we took notes on verbals after a five minute vocab quiz.</p>

    <p><b>Resource - 2nd Period</b></p>
    <p>With Max I didn't have resource, it cycled out.</p>
    <p>I took him to Campus Ministry, where they do morning prayer during 2nd period and also we ran into the 2 seniors I knew at the time (now I know 7), both named Mike. They are very nice people and I might actually write a seperate story on how we met.</p>
    <p>We continued the tour in the Academic Center, which is where one can get tutoring, make up a test, or do homework.</p>
    <p>I then took him to the Engineering Makerspace, which opened in the fall of 2017, that's a place where the Robotics team eets, students can 3D print stuff, and more.</p>
    <p>I took him to the Library and introduced him to more friends and we stayed there for the rest of the period.</p>

    <p><b>Religion - 3rd Period</b></p>
    <p>I then took him to Religion class, with Mr. Paul. I forgot what we did.</p>

    <p><b>Lunch</b></p>
    <p>Good food. Much more confident.</p>

    <p><b>Algebra 2 - 4th Period</b></p>
    <p>Yes, Mr. G knows Amith's older brother, who transferred to a much better school for juniors and seniors.</p>
    <p>He wasn't that bad at Algebra 2.</p>

    <p><b>French - 5th Period</b></p>
    <p>1. I didn't teach him a new word, but he was fine.</p>
    <p>He, like Max, takes Spanish in middle school, and plans to continue here.</p>

    <p><b>Biology - 6th Period</b></p>
    <p>We were in the lab, yay.</p>
    <p>The lab was something microscope-related, very hard.</p>

    <p>I walked back to Admissions with him and we split.</p>

    <p>The Admissions lady, during the drop off, said that I was "very enthusiastic and a great host".</p>

    <p> <i>Update, November 25, 2020: Amith is a f--king genius. He was in pre-calculus as a freshman, and is in my Java 2 class this year (as a sophomore). I haven't compared our heights yet.</i> </p>
