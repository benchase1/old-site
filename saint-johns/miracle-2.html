<h1>The Second Miracle</h1>
<h3>March 11, 2019</h3>

<p>It happened again. I got another kid to shadow me at Saint John's.</p>

<p>I'm in homeroom on March 8. She walks in, like she does everyday with a smile on her face, and calls my name.
It was 8:i-didnt-look-at-the-clock am and I'm fully awake. I'm aware that I may have a math test (which was moved) and sign the paper.</p>

<p>Once Monday morning comes, I'm ready and I'm there before Amith (the kid's name).
I go to homeroom and check in with Tony and tell him "I'm gonna get the...I'm not gonna repeat that line again".
That line was "I'm gonna go get the kid" which I said before getting Max. I had Amith for the entire day this time around, since I had no tests.</p>

<p>In English we took notes on verbals after a five minute vocab quiz.</p>

<p>With Max I didn't have resource, it cycled out. This time, I had resource, so I gave Amith a short tour.
I took him to Campus Ministry, where they do morning prayer during 2nd period and also we ran into the 2 seniors I knew at the time, both named Mike.
They are very nice people and I might actually write a seperate story on how we met.
We continued the tour in the Academic Center, which is where one can get tutoring, make up a test, or do homework.
I then took him to the Engineering Makerspace, which opened in the fall of 2017, that's a place where the Robotics Team meets, students can 3D print stuff, and more.
I took him to the Library and introduced him to more friends and we stayed there for the rest of the period.</p>

<p>I then took him to religion class, with Mr. Paul. I forgot what we did. Knowing Mr. Paul, we probably did something fun.</p>

<p>At lunch, I had pasta again. I was much more confident going through the lunch line, as I had already done it before.</p>

<p>I walked into math class and introduced Amith to Mr. G, who knows Amith's older brother, who transferred to a much better school for juniors and seniors.
He wasn't that bad at Algebra 2.</p>

<p>In French, I didn't teach him a new word, but he was fine. He, like Max, takes Spanish in middle school, and plans to continue here.</p>

<p>In biology, we were in the lab that day. I liked that, but the lab was something microscope-related, which was very hard.</p>

<p>After the day had ended, I walked back to the admissions office with him and we split.
The admissions lady, during the drop off, said that I was "very enthusiastic and a great host".</p>

<p> <i>Update, November 25, 2020: Amith is a f--king genius. He was in pre-calculus as a freshman, and is taking Java 2 in his sophomore year. I haven't compared our heights yet.</i> </p>
