<p>Speech from P-cubed, March 21, 2019: the way it was supposed to be<br>
Adapted for use in Mr. [redacted]&rsquo;s class on March 22</p>

<p></p>

<p>At every P-cubed, there is a section, before closing prayer and pizza, called open forum. Anyone can get up, and talk about whatever. It can be about the small group session, or just a simple &ldquo;sub to Pewdiepie&rdquo;. Everything is accepted. At yesterday&rsquo;s P-cubed, I decided to get up and go up to the higher up portion of the chapel. The topic for yesterday&rsquo;s gathering was priorities. I have some stage fright, so I was very nervous to make this speech, but I had the seniors supporting me throughout the entire time. My biggest inspiration for making this speech was [redacted], who was brave enough to speak about a time he was bullied in 6th grade.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I started this speech with asking how much of the crowd knew me. I was expecting maybe at most 10 to 15 hands to go up. There were probably about 25 to 30 hands up, including most of the seniors, Mr. [redacted], and many others. I never felt more like a celebrity before in my life.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There was also a time where I felt like a celebrity. It was the day after I got my Saint John&rsquo;s acceptance letter. I told one friend and they told another friend, and that friend told like 75 people who all went like &ldquo;Congratulations, Ben.&rdquo;.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Last night&rsquo;s feeling had more to it. I realized then and there that there were seniors that knew me. As a freshman in high school, that was also a near nobody in middle school, it felt amazing that they knew me.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Most people say in most high schools, &ldquo;seniors rule the school&rdquo;, but here at Saint John&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s almost like that, but you get seniors like the ones at P-cubed that care for everyone, freshmen included. It would be nice for them to truly know what I had to say last night, and they only got me with the stage fright. But it was the best I could do last night. It might feel weird for them, especially because some people think its weird to be a junior or a senior and seen hanging out with a freshman, but these boys really like me.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Back in middle school, I was a near nobody, as mentioned earlier. All the popular kids were the ones getting C&rsquo;s and D&rsquo;s and weren&rsquo;t thinking about their future. They were the ones on the middle school football team and football was their number one priority.</p>

<p></p>

<p>My number one priority throughout eighth grade was my schoolwork because I wanted to come to Saint John&rsquo;s. I knew it was the right school for me. I was perfectly fine with having two or three friends and no social life after school, mainly because I was focusing on my grades to come to Saint John&rsquo;s.</p>

<p></p>

<p>And that move up to Saint John&rsquo;s turned out to be the right move. I am doing fairly well for high school honors classes, with A&rsquo;s, B&rsquo;s, and C&rsquo;s. I know I said that the middle school kids with C&rsquo;s weren&rsquo;t that good, but middle school is meant to be easier than high school.</p>

<p>As for the popular kids back home, they are still most likely stupid and annoying. In a few years I bet they will be doing drugs. This isn&rsquo;t to say that all kids at the school with them are also stupid themselves, because there are kids that are smart and want to be successful. Those are the kids I am finding out all this information about the popular kids of middle school from.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The seniors here at Saint John&rsquo;s are really friendly to me, especially the ones I met first, [redacted] and [redacted]. They were the ones who I talked to while balling my eyes out in February. They told me that it happens to everyone while they are at Saint John&rsquo;s.</p>

<p></p>

<p>While we were eating the pizza last night in Campus Ministry, everyone was coming up to me and saying how much of a great job I did saying that speech. It&rsquo;s not easy going up and talking in front of a bunch of people, especially without a script to read from, but [redacted] was standing right next to me the whole time and helping me along.</p>

<p></p>

<p>During the small group session, my small group was talking about how important it was to be friends with your teachers. The one teacher I have that I would say I&rsquo;m friends with is Mr. [redacted]. He was there in the chapel last night encouraging me to keep going with my speech. I go to Campus Ministry every day and chat with him. I&rsquo;m usually the first one to sign up for P-cubed through him.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Before eating the pizza, he came up to me and gave me a hug. This time, which was unlike last week at Apex, I gave him the hug as well. It&rsquo;s nice to know that I have a teacher like Mr. [redcated] who will always be there to support me.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Last night, I was called by the seniors &ldquo;one of them&rdquo;. I felt like I earned that statement about myself. I bet that when I become a senior, maybe I&rsquo;ll be a senior leader just like them.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Our next P-cubed will be happening on Thursday, April 4th, starting at 5:00 in the chapel. I might make another speech like this one. The cost is $5 to attend and I expect signups to be open around the end of next week. My speech, if I choose to do one, will happen around 6:15. Please note that if you want to come to see my speech, you have to attend the entire event.</p>
