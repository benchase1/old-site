<title>Winter Open House 2020 - Ben Chase</title>

<h1>Winter Open House 2020</h1>
<h3>March 4, 2020</h3>

<p>This is the third open house of the 2019-20 school year, and an interesting one. Saint John's doesn't usually do
a winter open house, mainly because acceptances had already gone out (for the class of 2024 this year). However, somebody
decided to do another one, and there was a fairly good crowd.</p>

<p>I wasn't planning on helping out at this one. I had a math meet earlier that afternoon, and luckily made it back to school
in time to help out. I walked up to Campus Ministry before the open house started and asked if they needed help. Help was needed.</p>

<p>I took a brief trip next door where some of the clubs were being schowcased. One of them was the school newspaper. I wrote for them
<a href="pcubed-leader-article.html">in November</a>, and there as my article on the latest edition of the paper, for parents and
prospective students to see.</p>

<p>I went back over to Campus Minsitry, where it was just me and the Campus Ministry director for the entire two hour open house. The two of
us were able to answer every question we got asked, and I did a great job at explaining Campus Ministry to new families. (It's a very tough
department to understand. Many new students have no clue what we do. It's not like the Math department, which just has to explain when kids
take caluclus or geometry, and how to not take geometry.)</p>
