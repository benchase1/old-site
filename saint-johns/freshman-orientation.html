<h1>Freshman Orientation</h1>
<h3>August 29, 2018</h3>

<p>Here we are, my first official day of high school.</p>

<p>It was a Wednesday in August 2018. The high temperature that day was 89 at the airport on 
    the west side of Worcester.</p>

<p>My day started like any other day in high school. I got up around 6:45 that morning. 
    I ate a small breakfast, and my mom drove me to school.
</p>

<p>When we got to the school, everyone else from the class of 2022 was being dropped off by 
    the school gymnasium, where I got a name tag that had my name and homeroom (which was 206). 
    There were papers taped up with the homeroom numbers for you to find your classmates.
</p>

<p>The senior leaders brought me and about 25 others up to room 206. The teacher, Mr. Murphy, had 
    not arrived yet. <i>Little did I know, but this would be a staple of the coming years.</i> 
    I didn't know what to expect of him. Turns out, he is an old, but very nice man. He teaches English.
</p>

<p>We started the day getting to know some of the senior leaders and our classmates in our homeroom. 
    <i>I don't remember who I was paired with, but it was not one of the 7 I met that year.</i>
</p>

<p>We also got to do a scavenger hunt, finding various places around the school. That was fun, and 
    it was the last activity of the day.
</p>

<p>I then went around to meet all of my teachers and listen to their speels about their class and 
    what we should know at the beginning of the year. I liked all of my teachers freshman year.
</p>

<p>I ended my day by going home. I came back the next.</p>
