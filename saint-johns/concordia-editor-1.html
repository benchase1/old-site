<h1>Concordia: From the Editor</h1>
<h3>June 25, 2021</h3>

<p><i>Between June 24, 2021 and July 23, 2021, I served as the editor of Concordia, the 
    official newsletter of the Saint John's Summer Programs. Every week I wrote a short 
    reflection to all the readers of the newsletter. I have added these reflections to this website. 
    My email was not included at the end of the newsletter.

<p>Hey everyone! My name is Ben Chase, I am a rising senior at Saint John’s, and I was asked to
serve as the editor for this year’s Concordia newsletter. Some of you may have noticed me
around the school taking pictures, some of which appeared alongside the articles included in
this newsletter. In addition to serving as the editor, I am also one of the leaders of the
Photography Club at Saint John’s. During the process of capturing photos this week, I have
seen the enjoyment coming from both students and their teachers, and everyone seems very
happy to be back on campus after the struggles of the pandemic. This year is the first year that
we have had this large of a variety of programs being offered live on campus, and it turned out
to be a huge success. We hope to bring you a new edition of the Concordia newsletter every
week for the duration of the Summer Programs. Students and instructors, do you have
anything that you want to share with the newsletter? If you do, feel free to send me an email
with a short article and a couple photos for inclusion in a future edition of Concordia. My
email is included at the end of this newsletter. Thanks to all the teachers and student
volunteers helping to make this summer the best it can be!</p>
