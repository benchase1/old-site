<title>The Sweet 16 - Ben Chase</title>

<h1>The Sweet 16</h1>
<h3>November 1, 2019</h3>

<p>For those who don't know what a "Sweet 16" is, it is a party held by teenage girls around their 16th birthday. A Sweet 16 usually is held in a small function hall (this one at a golf course clubhouse), and includes food, drinks (non-alcoholic), and a dance floor. I was invited to one. I was with my brother, so confidence took a hit.</p>

<p>The party ran from 7:00 to 11:00 pm on a Friday night (and don't worry - it had chaperones).</p>

<p>Dinner included chicken fingers, pasta, and (i forgot). It was good. I had a bit to much caffeine though as it was nearly endless soda.</p>

<p>At 8:12 pm though, I started texting Oscar for help. (the message just says &quot;help&quot;)</p>

<p>I have the entire conversation archived. (Oscar - if you want this taken down, just message me.)</p>

<p>Ben, 8:12 pm: help<br>
Oscar, 8:43 pm: Okie dokie<br>
B, 8:44: I got invited to a sweet 16<br>
B, 8:44: there are probably more girls than boys<br>
B, 8:44: I don't know what to do<br>
O, 8:44: Advice time<br>
O, 8:45: Confidence<br>
O, 8:45: Biggest thing by far<br>
O, 8:45: #2<br>
O, 8:45: Have a personality<br>
O, 8:46: Don't just be a brick wall<br>
O, 8:46: Even if people don't get what you're into, it's way better to be interested in something people don't get than absolutely nothing<br>
<i>(The above is one of my favorite quotes from Oscar.)</i><br>
B, 8:46: thanks buddy<br>
B, 8:47: but the only interesting thing about me is that I'm a p cubed leader<br>
O, 8:47: You have absolutely no hobbies or passions?<br>
B, 8:47: not really<br>
O, 8:48: Incorrect<br>
B, 8:48: I'm on the math team there is nothing more boring than that<br>
O, 8:48: You have volunteering, personal development, group leadership, public speaking, and math<br>
B, 8:49: ok my public speaking is horrible<br>
B, 8:49: did you see me last night<br>
<i>(For context, the October 2019 P-Cubed was the night before this.)</i><br>
O, 8:49: You don't have to be good, just passionate<br>
O, 8:50: And you have that<br>
O, 8:50: You probably more passionate about P^3 than I am about anything else<br>
O, 8:51: Don't forget that<br>
O, 8:52: Advice #3<br>
B, 8:52: yeah I have that passion<br>
O, 8:52: Dress up<br>
B, 8:52: I stayed in dress code<br>
B, 8:52: but without the jacket<br>
O, 8:52: Not as far as I do but a little<br>
O, 8:53: That's good<br>
B, 8:53: I was gonna go up and dance<br>
B, 8:53: but then the one song I can dance to ended<br>
<i>(This song is the one where you slide to the left and right. Easy dance.)</i><br>
O, 8:54: I can't dance tbh<br>
O, 8:54: So you're ahead of me<br>
B, 8:54: I'm really bad<br>
O, 8:55: I also haven't been invited to any social event ever<br>
B, 8:55: I probably was invited because my brother was invited<br>
B, 8:55: but I'll never know<br>
O, 8:55: Well that's still ahead of me</p>
