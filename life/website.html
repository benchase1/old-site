<title>Starting the Website - Ben Chase</title>

<h1>Starting the Website</h1>
<h3>December 13, 2017</h3>

<p>The front page of this website states that this website was created by me on December 13, 2017.</p>

<p>In order to start this website, I needed to learn HTML, the coding language that creates this website.
The beginning of my education in HTML began on October 22, 2017, when I went to my local library and got a book on
coding in HTML. (My third grade teacher would be proud of me.)</p>

<p>Within an hour I had a small webpage up on my computer with whatever happened in the Chase house that day.
This wasn't on the internet for everyone yet, I didn't know how to do that. <i>If I ever find that file, I will put it
up on this website.</i></p>

<p>Fast forward to December 12. I was watching a YouTube video on how to make a website for free. This was not a scam.
If it was a scam, this would not be here until 2023.</p>

<p>At 7:37 am on December 13 (<i>I don't usually use times because it's very detailed, except for <a href="../saint-johns/shadow-day.html">here</a>,
but this is special.</i>), I registered the original .tk domain (benchaseyt.tk, changed to current on April 24, 2019).</p>

<p>I showed my friends the website later that afternoon after I finished setting it up around 2:00 pm. (My middle school did not
  have us do much work, therefore I could set up a whole simple landing page.) They thought it was cool.</p>

<p>That afternoon at home was spent further improving the website, and the rest is history.</p>

<p>Here I am in January 2021 writing this, and it's still up. The website has been moved around a lot of times (and even switched away from hand-coded a few times).
  It's still up. I still enjoy writing things here.</p>
