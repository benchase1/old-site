<title>Boston and Back - Ben Chase</title>

<h1>Boston and Back</h1>
<h4>May 17, 2018</h4>

<p>May 17, 2018, 3:45 am, Ben's home. This is the time my alarm was set to for a trip into the city of Boston, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The purpose of this trip was to bring my grandmother and aunt to Logan Airport for a flight (actually two, connection in Detroit) to Alpena, Michigan. This was also the day I clinched (traveled the entire length of) Interstate 90 within the state of Massachusetts (eastbound only) by traveling the 12 miles between Millbury and Westboro.</p>

<p>The drive in was nothing too special, just early in the morning.</p>

<p>It was then just me and my dad in Boston at 5:00 am on a school day. We watch the sun rise over Logan Airport and then travel home. I wake up Aiden around 6:30 am and we go to school.</p>

<p>Nobody cared that I went to Boston earlier that morning.</p>

<p><i>Two months later, on July 26, 2018, I fully clinch I-90 westbound by traveling that same 12 mile segment.</p>

<p>There have been two early morning airport trips since then with my grandmother (and once with my aunt as well) on August 10, 2018 and July 30, 2019. These may become stories in the future.</i></p>
