<title>P-Cubed Leadership: Year 2 - Ben Chase</title>

<h1>P-Cubed Leadership: Year 2</h1>
<h4>September 2019 - April 2020</h4>

<p>This is my second year of being a leader. At this point, I have already set the records for being the youngest and longest-serving member of the student leadership team at Saint John's.</p>

<p>Back in April 2019, I wrote <a href="http://file.benchase.tk/speech-042619.html">this speech</a>, which I never gave, and in that speech, I write: "I don't know what next year's seniors would be like, or the year after's." I had known two people in the class of 2020 at this point, and one in the class of 2021. I was genuinely scared because I thought I might lose the reputation I had built up freshman year.</p>

<p>When I spoke at the September 2019 P-Cubed on September 26, I was genuinely surprised when I was a part of the leadership team, after saying that I was an "unofficial leader".</p>

<p>The year progressed great, and in November, I filmed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BQqtgKgpuU">this video</a>, where I gained 20 subscribers (which dropped, and raised again). I had wrote an article for the school newspaper as well. In January I filmed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZnMlONIXIc">part of another video</a> during that P-Cubed on January 16.</p>

<p>I was at the February P-Cubed in spirit. Oscar gave a speech that time.</p>

<p>On April 30, we held a virtual P-Cubed on Zoom, and we got a good turnout of about 35 (including 4 or 5 staff members, which is great! I love to see staff involved in the activities.) We had hoped for a May P-Cubed but that didn't happen.</p>

<p>I'm a bit nervous for the class of 2021 leaders, but everything will hopefully be fine.</p>

<p>On to year three!</p>
