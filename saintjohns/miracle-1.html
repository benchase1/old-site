        <h1>The First Miracle</h1>
        <h3>February 7, 2019</h3>

        <p>By luck, I managed to get a kid shadowing me at Saint John's.</p>
        <p>Our story (like always) starts way before the actual event.</p>
        <p>We start on October 24, 2018, where the Admissions lady comes into my homeroom, and every other freshman homeroom and tells us about shadow hosting.</p>
        <p>She handed each interested student a form to fill out. I was one of them.</p>
        <p>The form had me filling out information such as my hometown, middle school, current grades, and interests.</p>
        
        <p>On November 15, I turned in the completed form, and then I got wating and waiting until I got a shadow.</p>
        <p>On November 29, waiting hasn't started yet, I had to go to a 30 minute long training session, where they discussed the rules and guidelines to hosting.</p>
        
        <p>The first of the shadows (will now be referred to as guests) arrived on December 3rd.</p>
        <p>Begin waiting period.</p>

        <p>On February 6, at 8:07 am, the Admissions lady comes in and calls my name. Note that I am half asleep at the time and don't initially hear her. A couple friends in my homeroom repeat her and I hear it that time.</p>
        <p>She said that I would be hosting a guest the following day, I was thrilled. I sign the papers, not realizing that I had two tests the following day.</p>
        <p>I ask Oscar, who sat behind me, to pinch me to make sure I wasn't dreaming. I wasn't.</p>
        <p>I, obviously, tell some people and, of course, my parents.</p>
        <p>I had to be at the Admissions office all ready for the day by 8:00 am.</p>
        
        <p>The next morning came, I was up at 6:20 am, and left the house at 7:10.</p>
        <p>I got to school around 7:45, got ready for the day, and was at Admissions at 7:50.</p>
        <p>Me and the Admissions lady talk about the two tests I have and my plans for what I am going to do with my guest, Max, during those classes.</p>
        <p>I decide to give him to Jackson, who would be in history, and Brody, yes the one and the only Brody, who would be in math (Algebra I).</p>
        <p>Max shows up at Admissions at 7:55 and we walk to homeroom together.</p>
        <p>Jackson tells me he has a quiz, and he trades with Phineas, who was in guitar.</p>
        <p>I introduce him to my homeroom teacher and we then take a walk to Campus Ministry.</p>
        <p>I think Max liked Campus Ministry, but I couldn't tell.</p>
        <p>We talked about the Math Team until announcements came on. We did the prayer and Pledge of Allgeiance. After I told Max that he didn't need to know the prayer just yet.</p>
        
        <p>We left for Religion, which was right down the hall.</p>
        <p>Max sat right behind me for the entire class.</p>
        <p>I call Phineas over to take Max, and they head on out to guitar class.</p>

        <p>Fast forward through my Algebra II test......</p>

        <p>I meet Max and Phineas outside the back of Founders Hall and I take Max to French class.</p>
        <p>He learned one word in that class (hey I taught him something), l'été, which means summer.</p>
        <p>We went to lunch and I got a pasta and Max got a burger. Max got a free lunch, while I had to pay $6, with a free brownie.</p>
        <p>This was my first time buying lunch and it was fairly good.</p>
        <p>We went off to Biology for long block. I saved this fact for now, but Max's dad is actually a Biology teacher at the school, but not the one I have now, but the one I shadowed in.</p>
        <p>We did this annoying assignment with karyotypes, and we had to match the chromosomes.</p>
        
        <p>After that was history, where we watched a video, I had to take notes on it.</p>
        <p>The video had some inappropriate scenes, but this is high school.</p>

        <p>I called Brody over to take Max to his Algebra I class.</p>

        <p>Fast forward through my English test......</p>

        <p>I walk down the hall to meet Brody and Max after their math class.</p>

        <p>Max said that somebody copied off him and somebody else copied off of them.</p>

        <p>I walked Max back to Admissions and the Admissions lady asked us how the day went.</p>

        <p>Max: "Good."<br>
        Me: "Great!"</p>

        <p>And then we went our own ways.</p>

        <p><b>The End.</b></p>
