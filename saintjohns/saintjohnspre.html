<h1>Saint John's Before I Go There (May 31, 2017 - August 28, 2018)</h1>

<p><b>Initial Start (Update 0):</b> February 17, 2018</p>

<p>Before, we get started, Saint John's is a school somewhere that any reader of this page does not need to know. I applied to join the Class of 2022 as a freshman, and got accepted. That's all the backstory needed.</p>

<p>Our story does not actually start on the day of the shadow, but instead, starts on May 31, 2017.</p>

<p>That day, was the day I first saw the school. Every year, in late May, they host an event called Preview Day. 6th and 7th graders, as well as their families, come to the school and sit through a presentation about the school and what they offer. After that, the go on a guided tour of the campus. I also did this my freshman year, in 2019.</p>

<p>On October 22, 2017, I went back there for their Open House. Instead of someone taking a group on a tour, I toured the campus at my own pace. There I also saw representatives from many clubs, like the Math Team, Chess Club, Gaming Club, and my personal favorite, Breakfast with Books.</p>

<p>Six days later, on October 28, I had to go there to take the Entrance Exam. The test started at 8:30 am and lasted 3 hours. It was nothing to worry about, it just wanted to give the school an early judgement on what classes I'll be in.</p>

<p>It was the week of December 11, 2017, where I had to do probably the hardest part and what I think determines if you get accepted or not. This was known as the Student Statements. I had to answer 5 questions in complete sentences on a computer. This was done at home. As well as that, my parents had to get my middle school records transferred over and they had statements to answer as well.</p>

<p>It was the afternoon of January 11, 2018. I had just got home from school and we decided to schedule my shadow day. We were aiming for Friday, January 26, but that was full, we couldn't do February 2nd, February 9th was full, and February 16, the day before February Break, was also full, so we settled on the 15th.</p>

<p>It was then the afternoon of February 8, 2018. I had got home from school 20 minutes earlier. I go get a snack and my mom had just got home and checked the mail, and there it was, a bigger-than-normal envelope from Saint John's addressed to me. I walked upstairs to my dad's office, where he was working. I open the envelope very slowly and read the letter on top out loud. Here's what I can remember from the beginning:</p>

<p>"Dear Ben Chase, It is my honor to congratulate your acceptance into the Saint John's Class of 2022!"</p>

<p>Then it went on and on about finanical aid, the reception for accepted students, more on that later, and some important dates, also will be explained later.</p>

<p>The next day, I go to school. I tell my friends, Gabby and Emma, yes they are girls, currently I am not dating, that something came in the mail. I telll them that I got accepted and then Gabby tells her friend Brendan, who has a brother that goes to Saint John's, about it, and then he texts his mom, she congratulates me, and then Brendan tells about 70 kids that I have got in to the school. Gabby tells my science teacher and the following Monday, I tell my substitute in art class, Mr. Walles, who is the best substitute in the whole entire world.</p>

<!-- Cut out shadow day, split to shadow-day -->
<p>I got home around 2:55 pm. That marked the end of the shadow day. But there is still more to our story.</p>

<p>It was 5:05 pm, on that same day. Since I got accepted, I was invited to a reception, where I could meet other people that also got accepted.</p>

<p>The reception started at 5:45. We parked, and then walked towards the Salem Student Commons, aka the cafeteria, located in Conal Hall.</p>

<p>There was a junior standing outside and he told us that I go into the Salem Student Commons, and my parents, to go to the Parent Reception, in Founders Hall.</p>

<p>He walked me in and told me what to do.</p>

<p>After I walked in, I waited in a short line to check in and then I grabbed a t-shirt that read "Pioneer Nation".</p>

<p>I high-fived the mascot, a pioneer, and then grabbed some pizza, soda, and met some fellow classmates.</p>

<p>I met 2 people, Mateo and Peter.</p>

<p>They were both very nice, but I talked to Mateo more.</p>

<p>He was from Worcester, and we talked about how crazy bad my middle school's beasketball league was.</p>

<p>Peter, who I didn't talk to much, was from Westboro.</p>

<p>Around 6:25 pm, we all learned the chants they used to make their crazy fan section very crazy.</p>

<p>Then, around 6:30, parents and students made their way to the gym for the 7:00 basketball game against Algonquin, their rival.</p>

<p>I only stayed through the 1st quarter, since I apparently had an algebra test the next day (by the way I got a 95 on it).</p>

<p>The game was a chanting war. Both teams' fans were chanting about how much better they were than the other.</p>

<p>Then the 1st quarter ended and we left. St. John's was up 19-17 though.</p>

<p>That brings us up to the time I begin writing this, February 17, 2018.</p>

<p><b>Update 1:</b> March 10, 2018</p>

<p>On March 16, 2018, the Gaming Club hosted a gaming night for all accepted freshman. They had pizza, soda, and of course, video games.</p>

<p>The pizza was very good, the soda was soda.</p>

<p>I played Mario Kart (i think 8, since it was on the Nintendo Switch. <b>2020 edit:</b> it was 8), Rocket League (PS4), and Super Smash Bros. (Wii U).</p>

<p>I won both Rocket League games (2v2), the first 8-3 against Mateo and someone else, and the second game was stopped a minute and a half in when we were up 5-0 against members of the gaming club.</p>

<p>Super Smash: last place every single time</p>

<p>In Mario Kart, I did fairly well, averaging like 8th place every race, except one race where I was against the supervisor of the gaming club and Mr. Smith, the Director of Admissions, aka the dude that thought it was a good idea to accept me into the Class of 2022. I got in like 2nd place against those two. Mr. Smith thought it was good to get in 9th and somehow bent his thumb while playing.</p>

<p><b>Update 2:</b> March 23, 2018</p>

<p>On April 12, 2018, while I am at my middle school's annual lip sync, my parents are at Curriculum Night.</p>

<p>On April 22, 2018 at 10:44 am, I make my decision to go to Saint John's.</p>

<p>The next day all the important acceptance stuff happens.</p>

<p><b>Update 3:</b> April 29, 2018</p>

<p>On May 19th, I went up for the Freshman Placement Exams. I only had to take the math test because I am beginning a new language.</p>

<p>On May 25th, (somewhat related?), was the <a href=../middleschool/springfling18.html>Spring Fling</a> at my middle school, where the whole school competes in these weird events. There was a tie between the 6th and 8th grades and we had a chanting war, just like St. John's vs. Aloginquin on February 15.</p>

<p><b>Update 4:</b> May 25, 2018</p>

<p>On June 12th, there was an informational night talking about things like bussing and dress code as well as some other stuff. I got my preliminary course listing that night which included Algebra 2 Honors which I am actually proud of myself for getting in there because I got an 84 on my last report card in Algebra 1 but they may have changed that course.</p>

<p>Between July 2nd and July 6th (not July 4th though) I had work study. Work study is basically you help the custodians over the summer for a week, we pay part of your tuition.</p>

<p>It wasn't bad at all. The heaviest thing I lifted was a desk. Everything else was put on wheels.</p>

<p>I worked between 8:00am and 3:30pm with 4 other kids.</p>

<p>We were all around the campus and we got to learn a little bit more about the campus doing this.</p>

<p>The following week (July 9 - 13) was the week I did Freshman Leadership, a summer class between 12:30 and 3:30pm which was recommended for all incomin g freshman, but about 60 kids did it thorughout the three sessions.</p>

<p>On Monday (July 9), we took a tour of the campus after watching some movie clips about leadership.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, we took a trip to Ultimate Obstacles in West Boylston. I had fun there.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, we did community service aka 2 hours of weeding in the Great Brook Valley of Worcester.</p>

<p>On Thursday, we went to Central Rock Gym (also in Worcester) after meeting the founder of Central Rock Gym which has 10 locations around the Northeast.</p>

<p>On Friday, two incoming sophomores (one was the kid I shadowed back in February and the other works at Central Rock Gym) and two incoming seniors came and answered some questions we had about the school. After that we watched the movie Invictus, which is about the South African rugby team in the 1995 Rugby World Cup.</p>

<p><b>Update 5:</b> July 13, 2018</p>

<p>On August 16, I went up for Freshman Picture Day. Since my last name starts with a C, I was in the first group (A-H) from 8:30 - 9:30 am. I was out at 8:40 am. The pictures were taken in the Black Box Theatre.</p>

<p><b>Update 6 (Final Update):</b> August 17, 2018</p>
