<h1>YouTube Channel</h1>

<p>My <a href="http://www.youtube.com/benchase1">YouTube channel</a> began on January 17, 2014 when I uploaded a video of me playing Minecraft. Between then and August 25, 2017, I gained 73 subscribers and nobody watched my videos (max 5 views each). I deleted the channel after pressure from family. I recreated the channel on September 1, 2017 to create better content, and have since gained 89 subscribers and over 1,500 views.</p>

<p>Various friends of mine have been featured in my videos.</p>
