<h1>About</h1>

<p>This is the website for me, Ben Chase.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>This website was created by me on December 13, 2017. Not the coded site, but the original domain, www.benchaseyt.tk, was registered.<br>
I put the website on uCoz for the first day.<br>
The following day, December 14, I switched over to 000webhost, created a Wordpress sie, and sometime in early 2018, switched to Awardspace.<br>
I ended up moving back from there and started this coded site.<br>
Between April and August 2018, I had switched back and forth from a coded to Wordpress site and experimented with subdomains (i used old and beta)<br>
After that, I just left this here.<br>
On April 28, 2019, I switched the site to a new domain, www.benchase.tk, registered the week before.</p>

<h3>What's here?</h3>
<p>On this site, I have a bunch of stories about random crap.</p>
