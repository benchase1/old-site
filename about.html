<h1>About</h1>

  <p>This is the website for me, Ben Chase.</p>
  
  <p>Ben Chase was born on October 17, 2003 (age 16) in the state of Massachusetts. He is currently a sophomore in high school, and is aspiring to be a civil engineer. He became a transportation enthusiast in March 2009, and transportation has been a hobby of his ever since.</p>

<p>Ben started creating content on his YouTube channel on January 17, 2014 when he uploaded a video of him playing Minecraft. His content has changed throughout the years, from gaming to vlogging and sharing his personal experiences. He made history at his school in May 2019 when he completed his first year of being a leader at school events. He is the youngest and longest-serving member of the school's current student leadership team.</p>

<p>Ben's music career began in April 2019, when Fork was released. He has since released two other albums under the Fork name.</p>

<p>Ben started doing community service work in June 2016 in his hometown, and travelling for service through Young Neighbors in Action in July 2019.</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>I started this website on December 13, 2017, when I registered the domain and started an HTML site, with the new coding skills I spent two months learning and practicing on smaller scales.</p>
<p>After 21 months and 3 days, the site moved to Google Sites on September 16, 2019, where it currently lies today.</p>
<p>As a project to capture the history, the old site was revived on May 29, 2020.</p>

<h3>What's here?</h3>
<p>On this site, I have a bunch of stories about random crap.</p>
