<h1>About</h1>

<p>This is the website for me, Ben Chase.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>I started this website on December 13, 2017, when I registered the domain and started a Wordpress site.</p>
<p>The site transitioned to HTML on February 16, 2018, when I started writing the first Saint John's story.</p>
<p>After 19 months, the site moved to Google Sites on September 16, 2019, where it currently lies today.</p>
<p>As a project to capture the history, the old site was revived on May 29, 2020.</p>

<h3>What's here?</h3>
<p>On this site, I have a bunch of stories about random crap.</p>
