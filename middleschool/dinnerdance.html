<h2>The Dinner Dance - May 11, 2018</h2>

<p>This was a pretty fun night for me, except for the hour leading up to it.</p>

<p>That hour was filled with crazy moms taking pictures.</p>

<p>Now to the dance.</p>

<p>About 155 kids went.</p>

<p>First we checked in with Mrs. Tappin, my 8th grade science teacher.</p>

<p>Then we ate meatballs and pasta for dinner.</p>

<p>And then most of us danced (there were like 20 who decided Fortnite was what they wanted).</p>

<p>Dancing = jump up and down screaming the song lyrics.</p>

<p>I did that most of the time, and then for like 5 minutes I started doing that thing where I start moving my feet around really fast.</p>

<p>Everyone started chanting my name (this is the exception to the Invisible Ben thing).</p>

<p>And now this is why it took me 2 months to put out this story.</p>

<p>It's all in this next sentence.</p>

<p>I got kissed my a girl.</p>

<p>I felt nervous to type that.</p>

<p>Yes, a girl named Molly came right up to me and tried getting me on the cheek, but instead got my around the ear.</p>

<p>And this happened like an hour into the dance (like half an hour after we all started dancing).</p>

<p>I then sat out for half an hour (and I regret doing that).</p>

<p>My fame was over, but not the dance.</p>

<p>I went back out for the last hour and a half for the dance.</p>

<p>And then I went home.</p>
