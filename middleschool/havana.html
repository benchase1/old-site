<h2>Official Lyrics</h2>

<p>Hold on, we need some backstory.</p>

<p>So my friend, Emma, who's 14th brithday was the day in which I started this website, she went to a Camilla Cabello concert in April.</p>

<p>She had been talking about it for like ever.</p>

<p>One day, her and Gabby discovered that I have a beautiful singing voice, which was dicovered when they heard me singing this song.</p>

<p>It became a tradition in which everyone wanted to hear me sing it.</p>

<p>The end of the backstory, so now go and enjoy the lyrics which took me about 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Hey</p>

<p>Havana, ooh na-na (ay)</p>

<p>Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay)</p>

<p>He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na</p>

<p>Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ay)</p>

<p>There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh huh)</p>

<p>Havana, ooh na-na (uh)</p>

<p>He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?" (uh)</p>

<p>(When he came in the room)</p>

<p>He said there's a lot of girls I can do with (uh)</p>

<p>(But I can't without you)</p>

<p>I knew him forever in a minute (hey)</p>

<p>(That summer night in June)</p>

<p>And papa says he got malo in him (uh)</p>

<p>He got me feelin' like</p>

<p>Ooh-ooh-ooh, I knew it when I met him</p>

<p>I loved him when I left him</p>

<p>Got me feelin' like</p>

<p>Ooh-ooh-ooh, and then I had to tell him</p>

<p>I had to go, oh na-na-na-na-na</p>

<p>Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay)</p>

<p>Havana, ooh na-na</p>
