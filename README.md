# old-site
Hello, readers! You have found the GitHub repository for my old wesbite.

I started my own website on December 13, 2017 after learning basic HTML on my own, and hard coded it until September 16, 2019, when I made the switch to Google Sites.

I have brought back the old site and will be updating it with any new info that has appeared on my new website, to preserve the format of HTML, or in the event that I do switch back to HTML.
