<title>History - Ben Chase</title>

<h1>Website History</h1>

<p><i>This was originally written to celeberate 1000 days on the internet on September 8, 2020.</i></p>

<p>Please, bear with me. This is a 1000 day history lesson on this website and the other sites that form the "network" I've created.</p>

<p>For 1000 days, I decided to recover the lost history of this website, and what my future plans are.
 <a href="http://file.benchase.tk/anniversary-011719">I've done this before.</a></p>

<p><i>If the lack of a comma in "1000" bothers you, <a href="contact">please get in touch</a>.</i></p>

<p>I have to try my best and remember 1000 days of history now...</p>

<h2>December 2017 to February 2018 - The Early Days of Nothing</h2>

<p>I always say that I started my website in 2017. The domain benchaseyt.tk was registered at 7:37 am on Thursday, December 13, 2017.
I was in the eighth grade at the time, and spent that entire school day setting the first site up. My teachers in the eighth grade did not care
about whatever students did during the day. They also bumped up kids' grades so they could keep their jobs. (Oh wait, that was two out of four teachers.)</p>

<p>That website stayed online for approximately 8 hours until I switched hosts. Here's the thing: I couldn't figure out how to edit the pages, more
 specifically, I couldn't remove the pre-placed text. Even during that 8 hours, people still saw it. My former friend Emma, who I haven't talked to since June 2018,
 was the first person that was not me to visit the site. She was an amazing supporter for the site's first six months, and has been the greatest inspiration to me as
I continue building this site.</p>

<p>I moved over to Wordpress afterwards. I could actually edit the pages. I was on Wordpress for about 2 months. That inital two months had a lot of internal
thinking. I wanted an email address for me (at site domain). So, I found a free host and created one. One issue - I couldn't send email from my Gmail to the new
 address. The proposed-in-my-head plan for the email was this:</p>

 <li>user@benchaseyt.tk: Users directly known and friends with me. I was one of four that could've held this level.</li>
 <li>user@2017.benchaseyt.tk: Users introduced to the site in 2017. I was one of three that could've held this level, with possibiility of more.</li>
 <li>user@2018.benchaseyt.tk: Users introduced to the site in 2018.</li>

<p>Issue 1: I didn't know how to set up a subdomain at that time.<br>
   Issue 2: Who wants a useless email?</p>

<p>And with that, ben@benchaseyt.tk was the only email ever registered through that system. Nobody tried to email it though.</p>

<p>The Wordpress site was just a fancier version of what was before. I don't fully remember if I put much on it though.</p>

<h2>February 2018 to Present - The Stories</h2>

<p>Hold up right there... this history lesson is not just two parts.</p>

<p>On February 15, 2018 <a href="saint-johns/shadow-day">this</a> happened. I wrote the story of it on February 17, 2018, and then it was the first interesting thing
on this site. The story was introduced as a "funny story" from the home page. Also with this story, was the HTML beginnings of the site. Since then, the HTML site has been part
of the site network (on multiple subdomains). The code of the original story has not changed since creation in 2018.</p>

<p>As I had more experiences in my life, I have added new stories to the site. I currently have three categories for stories. "Life" is for general life stories, not tied with school.
"Saint John's" is all the school stories since August 2018. "Middle School" is the school stories between 2014 and 2018.</p>

<p>The stories get good reviews from those who read them. In two and a half years, I have not been asked to remove a single word from any of them.</p>

<p>I always enjoy writing a new story when I get the chance to. It's a time to look back on the experiences that I had in the past.</p>

<h2>April 2019 to Present - The New Domain</h2>

<p>This was more of an impulse decision by me. Prior to April 24, 2019, my site was using the benchaseyt.tk domain. Long story short, I had removed the "yt" from the address,
as the site shifted away from my YouTube channel.</p>

<p>The new domain is home to quite a few subdomains as well, which I use for other projects of mine. If you successfully find one, then congrats. You've found a personal project
that I have chosen to share with the internet.</p>

<p>This new domain has my first working email. When I realized it worked, I was happy that the year-long goal was finally completed.</p>

<h2>May 2019 - Anarchy!</h2>

<p>This was a fun time of anarchy on a separate site, with a separate domain (benchase.ml), and with a few friends. This was just for fun and games, and the HTML site was still there
on its normal domain. This site had quite a bit, from absolute destruction to a since-removed-from-my-mind picture of a girl.</p>

<p>I deleted it after we destroyed it too much.</p>

<p>Also happening at this time - the same group of friends were <a href="http://file.benchase.tk/freshman-year-061519">planning a video</a>.</p>

<h2>September 2019 to July 2020 - The Lazy Era</h2>

<p>On September 16, 2019, I tried out Google Sites for my host. I've created a few things with them between 2012 and 2014. Why not try out their new site creator?
It was really good. I had moved all the text on my HTML site over, while still keeping it online (old subdomain). I wrote many more stories that were ported to
the HTML site in July 2020, when I deactivated the Google site.</p>

<p>The whole goal here was to allow people to contribute, like my goal with Wordpress, but without the destructive result of the anarchy site.</p>

<h2>July 2020 to Present - GitHub</h2>

<p>On September 11, 2019 I registered a GitHub account, to contribute on <a href="http://www.travelmapping.net">Travel Mapping</a>, a site used by many roadgeeks
to document their travels on road. I have used this account to start and delete many personal projects.</p>

<p>This is also how I hosted the old site while I used Google Sites. I downloaded the site backup, and uploaded it straight to GitHub. Easy.
Working on this site through GitHub is really easy. There's no host website to go through, as all prior host websites - except for Google - are slow to this day.
Also, others can edit this website. I'm not going into too much detail so this isn't destroyed.</p>

<h2>September 2020 and Onwards - The Future</h2>

<p>In the first 1000 days, this site has changed quite a lot. This site will remain online for the future, and I'll still be here developing it.</p>

<p>To celebrate 1000 days, I have provided an in-depth history of the site (this page).</p>
<p>I started this site not only to provide entertainment and for people to learn about me, but as a place to share my experiences that have deeply impacted my life, and
for readers to reflect and be motivated to do similar or different.</p>
