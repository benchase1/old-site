<p>Ben Chase, born October 17, 2003 (age 16), is the founder and creator of his YouTube channel and website.</p>
<p><i>From here on, this is written by Ben.</i></p>

<h4>Pre-Hobby Days - October 2003 to November 2008</h4>
<p>Obviously, I don't remember a thing from this era of my life because nothing memorable happened (because I was young).
We did move a few times. I grew up in a house on a main road. My mother didn't like that. They sold the home in early 2004.
Now that town has boomed and it's really nice now. Nicer then the town I live in.</p>

<h4>Boom-batta-boom, Hobbies Developed - November 2008 to August 2009</h4>
<p><i>For more info, see <a href="../life/tenyearsoftransit.html">Ten Years of Transit</a>.</i></p>
<p>To start this off, Barack Obama became US President. I became a transportation nerd in March 2009 travelling to Florida
(my first time on a plane) and I either really liked or really hated the tunnel by the airport in Boston.</p>

<p>In August 2009 I stepped on a train in New York City for the first time. Both this and the tunnel thing set a hobby for me.</p>

<h4>Education - 2007 to Present</h4>
<p>I go to school. That's all you need to know. Saint John's stories are available <a href="saintjohns.html">here</a>, and middle school
stories are available <a href="middleschool.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Entertainment</h2>
<p>Just like any other kid born around the same time as me, video games are the primary form of entertainment as I grew up. I had my fair
share of home game consoles throughout the years. I have enjoyed quite a few titles throughout all these systems.</p>

<h4>The Wii - 2009 to Present</h4>
<p><i>I don't know the exact year we got that thing. But it was not at release in 2006.</i></p>

<p>The Wii - everyone's either most-favorite or least-favorite gaming console. Me and my brother got this one year (either 2009 or 2010)
and we both enjoyed it. The Wii remains the easiest to use console that I've used. My favorite console would be the Nintendo Switch, which
I've only played with a friend (because I don't have one). I have memories of family and friends coming together to play Wii games.</p>

<p>I still play the Wii to this day, and still get enjoyment out of Wii Sports Resort. I lost Wii Sports somehow. Some of my favorite games
are Wii Sports Resort, Super Mario Galaxy (I should really play through this one), and Wii Party.</p>

<h4>The Xbox 360 - December 2012 to August 2019</h4>
<p>In December 2012, the Chase home got a video game upgrade, to the Xbox 360. That system was fun for what we had on it. I played Minecraft like
there was no tomorrow on the system. Memories weren't made on the Xbox though.</p>

<p>Favorite games here, uhh, Minecraft, London 2012. My brother bought quite the bit of sports games (basketball and football) for the system.</p>

<p>Sadly, on August 9, 2019, our Xbox was laid to rest with the "red ring of death", as a result of hardware failure.</p>

<h4>The Xbox One - June 2017 to Present</h4>
<p>On June 15, 2017, before the "red ring of death", we got another upgrade, to the Xbox One. I will say that this was a three-way console debate
for this one. My brother was going back and forth between Xbox One and PS4 (settled on Xbox One), and I wanted a Nintendo Switch (released March 2017).
The debate was settled when my dad bought the Xbox One (with Minecraft as a pack-in) for $400 (over the Switch's $300 tag).</p>

<p>Favorite games: Minecraft, Rocket League, Cities: Skylines. And that was all I got for the system. Yeah, my brother packed it with sports games again.
And those battle royale games that gained popularity in 2018 and 2019. I have played a fair share of Grand Theft Auto V, and it's too vulgar and obscene for me.</p>

<h4>Jobs - June 2019 to Present</h4>
<p>Let's put the video games away and move on to the next point in my life, working. I work for two reasons: Money (to buy a Nintendo Switch one day), and to get
out of the damn house.</p>

<p>My first job was working at a local beach. Work permit restrictions exist for a reason and 15 year old me had to cook when he shouldn't have and burned his hand.</p>

<p>I got fired the next summer, and applied to more places. I got two interviews. One at an assisted living place. And one at an ice cream place.</p>
